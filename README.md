A tentative Vim plugin for highlighting [Pollen](http://pollenpub.com/) markup that I made because it was too embarrassing to take screenshots of Pollen source versus rendered result without some kind of highlighting, however simple.

Install via [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#quick-start): add `Plugin 'fasiha/pollen.vim'` to your `vimrc` in the appropriate place.
